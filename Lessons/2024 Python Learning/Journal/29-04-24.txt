6/10

Caught a mouse, bit sad. Got messaged by recruiter at Mastercard for first intro interview which was cool. Watched next episode of baby reindeer which was really weird. Had a nice wing lunch with it (thanks dad). Amys friends thought I looked like Theo James which is so funny because James Savidge said that literally a few weeks ago and she thought it was ridiculous so HA.
