#1 =  a list
#3 = a different type of list, called a tuple, these are immutable

# lists are data types that can contain multiple objects 
#lists may also contain other lists

list(range(1, 10))

#list then range function  will output the numbers between the two numbers you put down
#note it will not output the final number, in this case 10
#note you must have a space after the comma in the range for the list to work

list(range(1, 10, 2))

#note, this new list will output the numbers between 1 and 10 (without 10 included), but do it in steps of 2
